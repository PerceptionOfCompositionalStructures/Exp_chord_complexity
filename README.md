# Chord Complexity Experiment

This experiment is done by Yaolong Ju, William Duffy, and Philippe Macnab-Séguin. The experiment asks the subject to rate the level of complexity for each chord. 

The experiment has been tested successfully on Windows 10 (64bit) and MacOS Sierra. The download link is here: [Windows](https://www.dropbox.com/s/v0jlncydj3o2y5u/Exp_chord_complexity_standalone_WIN64.zip?dl=0), [MacOS](https://www.dropbox.com/s/fchw5xw2ghtf63q/Exp_chord_complexity_standalone_MACOS.zip?dl=0).

When you manage to download the zip file, please unzip it in your computer and run `PairCompTestController`. When prompted to select a folder, choose the unzipped folder which contains the program. Then a message box will pop out to ask you some information before the experiment.

In case the program cannot run (in MacOS), please follow the instructions below:

1. Security dialogue appears saying file cannot be opened; click “OK".
2. Open System Preferences, and navigate to the “Security & Privacy” pane.
3. At the bottom of the “General” section, there will be a message saying that “Program” was clocked from opening; click the button labeled “Open Anyway".
4. Program will launch, and security dialogue will appear a second time; click “Open” to open the program and proceed with the experiment.

When the experiment finished, please go to the unzip folder, go into `Results` folder and the text file with your McGill ID will be your test result, then please send the result (text file, DON'T COPY the content of the text file to the email!) to Yaolong Ju (yaolong.ju@mail.mcgill.ca).

Also, if you have any question regarding the experiment, please contact Yaolong Ju (yaolong.ju@mail.mcgill.ca). Thank you for your cooperation!
