Please download the whole project as a zip file. Unzip it in your computer and run `PairCompTestController`, please choose your unzip folder. Then a message box will pop out to ask you some information before the experiment.

In case the program cannot run, please follow the instructions below:

1. Security dialogue appears saying file cannot be opened; click “OK".
2. Open System Preferences, and navigate to the “Security & Privacy” pane.
3. At the bottom of the “General” section, there will be a message saying that “Program” was clocked from opening; click the button labeled “Open Anyway".
4. Program will launch, and security dialogue will appear a second time; click “Open” to open the program and proceed with the experiment.

When the experiment finished, please go to the unzip folder, go into `Results` folder and the text file with your McGill ID will be your test result, then please send the result to Dr. Claire Arthur.
